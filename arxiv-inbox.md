# arXiv inbox

Papers the nightly arXiv digest suggested, waiting for a decision. Nothing here
is in the reading queue yet — the inbox is the tier *in front of* it.

Format:

- One paper per line: `<YYYY-MM-DD> — <title>`, optionally followed by
  ` — <arXiv id or URL>` (same title/ref convention as `reading-queue.md`).
- The date is the arXiv **announcement** date the digest ran against, and is
  the expiry anchor — not the day the paper was submitted.
- The Dashboard renders each line with four one-tap actions: ➕ add to the
  reading queue, 📥 intake into memory, 📑 make citeable, ✖️ dismiss.
- Un-acted lines **lapse after 7 days** (`INBOX_WINDOW_DAYS` in
  `scripts/inbox_actions.py`) and are swept by the nightly job. A swept line is
  not lost: git history holds it. This is deliberate — the never-delete rule in
  `reading-queue.md` protects *reading history*, and an un-acted suggestion is
  not history.
- Written by PyAutoMind's `arxiv_papers.yml`. Hand edits are safe but will race
  a nightly run; prefer the Dashboard buttons.
